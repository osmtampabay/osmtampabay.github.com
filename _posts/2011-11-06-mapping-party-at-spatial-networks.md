Last Thursday [Zac](http://twitter.com/zacmcc) threw together an unplanned OSM mapping party at the [Spatial Networks](http://spatialnetworks.com/) office. We called in the pizza guy and hung out in our conference room, getting everyone setup to use [JOSM](http://josm.openstreetmap.de/). After a few minutes, we were all editing different pieces of the map that interested _us_.

We had a lot of fun indocrinating some of our fellow developers who hadn't really committed to getting involved in OSM editing. The community continues to grow!

Check out the newly launched [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/osmtampabay/) to join and help us organize a series of regular mapping parties.
