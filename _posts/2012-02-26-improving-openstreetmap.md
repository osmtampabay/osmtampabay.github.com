[Tom MacWright](http://macwright.org/) started a [good discussion on the wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Improving_OpenStreetMap) about next steps and approaches to make improvements to OSM.

OSM’s architecture is powerful, yet can be way too intimidating to invite less tech-savvy newcomers to contribute. This discussion puts some things on the table that the OSM community at large isn’t talking about enough.
