This coming weekend is the second OpenStreetMap edit-a-thon event for 2013, and mapping groups from areas [all over the US](http://www.openstreetmap.us/2013/03/april-spring-editathon/) are getting together to see how much US-based editing we can get done over the course of the weekend. The event runs Saturday and Sunday (April 20-21), but the OSM Tampa Bay group is meeting up on Saturday, April 20th at 12:30pm in Dunedin, FL to hang out and see how much editing we can do.

We'll be meeting at the [Broadway Deli](http://www.meetup.com/osmtampabay/events/108831442/) in downtown Dunedin, and we plan on doing some mapping on the web, as well as walking around town doing some field mapping (weather-permitting). There's plenty of work to be done on the map data in the Tampa area. Here are some things we'll be looking at:

* Using [MapRoulette](http://maproulette.org/) to make quick fixes to transport data (US-wide)
* Improving buildings & points of interest in Dunedin, Tampa, Clearwater, and St. Pete
* Correcting streets to fix routing, lane counts, speed limits, etc.
* Field collection with [Pushpin](http://pushpinosm.org/) or other mobile apps
* And more...

There are a number of folks coming out who are well-versed in OpenStreetMap, so come out even if you've never made an edit! We'll be there to show you around the editing tools available, and how to make contributions to map features that interest you. Be sure to head over to the [meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/osmtampabay/events/108831442/) and RSVP if you want to come out!
