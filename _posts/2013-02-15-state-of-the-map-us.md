The 2013 edition of the [State of the Map US](http://stateofthemap.us/) conference was just announced, to be held in San Francisco on June 8th and 9th. I attended the conference in Portland, Oregon last year, and it was an great event. As it says on the site, the diverse and interesting group of enthusiasts that make it out to SotM is always incredible.

If you're interested in hearing a ton of fascinating ways people are working with and contributing to [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), it's well worth the trip.
