Learning the OSM editor stack can be complex to newcomers to OpenStreetMap, and even to people familiar with the project. Potlatch is where most new contributors start, since it's the editor built into the OSM website, and accessible right in the browser. But it has limitations to doing extensive, mass editing.

[JOSM](http://josm.openstreetmap.de/) is the tool of choice for the power user, but it's got quite the learning curve to getting comfortable with it. I've spent a good bit of time learning tons of tricks, like keyboard shortcuts, handy plugins, and techniques that make JOSM the best tool for heavy editing.

At [next weekend's meetup](http://www.meetup.com/osmtampabay/events/83510512/) (Sunday, September 30, 11am), we'll get together and talk about JOSM and how to get more comfortable editing with it. I plan to show some JOSM tips for doing things like:

* Editing building footprints
* Fixing and editing road geometry
* POI editing
* Land cover mapping
* Creating and managing relations
* Viewing edit history on objects
* How filters make editing much easier

Bring questions, ideas, and stuff to chat about!
