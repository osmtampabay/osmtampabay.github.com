We've [scheduled another meetup](http://www.meetup.com/osmtampabay/events/63429022/) for next **Saturday, May 19th**. It's been a while since our last _real_ get-together back in December. Since then a few of us hopped onto another meeting that happened back in February at USF, organized by fellow OSMTB member [Ed Hillsman](http://www.meetup.com/osmtampabay/members/8258333/). We had a good time over there, some of us just talked about OSM and messed around in JOSM, while others went out and surveyed some GPS tracks and collected data.

For this one, I thought we could get together and do some mapping in Potlatch or JOSM -- if some folks want to do that -- and we can walk the streets downtown and actually survey some new data, regroup back at JoJo's, and add it into the map that way. It'd be a nice change of pace from the typical geek-out session, and I think we could get a pretty sizable amount of data in a pretty short time. And hopefully we'll have nice weather for wandering around downtown.

Any other ideas are welcome, naturally! Hope to see you out there.
