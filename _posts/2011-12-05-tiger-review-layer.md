Ito World has created a [tiled layer](http://www.itoworld.com/product/data/ito_map/main?view=162&lat=27.885426094854562&lon=-82.55249973052682&zoom=11) showing the status of the [TIGER](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topologically_Integrated_Geographic_Encoding_and_Referencing) imported road data for the US on OpenStreetMap.

The layer shows roads that have been reviewed, not reviewed, and when they were last edited in the database. A surprising number of the major roads in the Tampa Bay area have been reviewed, but that doesn't necessarily mean the geometry has been corrected from the [error-prone original](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/File:TIGER_fixup_example_before.jpg) -- there's still [plenty of work to be done](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/TIGER_fixup).

If you're editing transportation network data on the map, remember to check out the latest [TIGER import documentation](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/TIGER_2010) on the wiki to get a feel for how the data is tagged. It's a fantastic data resource, but needs a fair amount of help to get up to a high standard of quality for routing.
