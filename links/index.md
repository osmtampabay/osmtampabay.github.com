### Mapping with OSM

**[Map Features](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features)** &mdash; The canonical resource for building data with OSM. When you're mapping, you'll want to have this right at your side.

**[LearnOSM](http://www.learnosm.org/)** &mdash; Documents and how-tos on using QGIS and mapping with JOSM and PotLatch.

**[WalkingPapers](http://walkingpapers.org/)** &mdash; Print out paper maps of OpenStreetMap data, draw and write notes by hand, and upload pics of your maps. WalkingPapers will georeference them to overlay on the map in JOSM to code in your data. Really neat.

**[Keepright](http://keepright.at/report_map.php?zoom=11&lat=27.88232&lon=-82.67811)** &mdash; Tampa Bay area map data issues from KeepRight.at. Good place to find things to fix in OSM.

**[Compare](http://osmtampabay.org/compare)** &mdash; Compare OSM to Google Maps. Helps to find gaps and unedited areas.

**[Keepright.at](http://keepright.at/report_map.php?zoom=12&lat=27.82722&lon=-82.703&layers=B0T&ch=0%2C30%2C40%2C50%2C70%2C90%2C100%2C110%2C120%2C130%2C150%2C160%2C170%2C180%2C191%2C192%2C193%2C194%2C195%2C196%2C197%2C198%2C201%2C202%2C203%2C204%2C205%2C206%2C207%2C208%2C210%2C220%2C231%2C232%2C270%2C281%2C282%2C283%2C284%2C285%2C291%2C292%2C293%2C294%2C311%2C312%2C313%2C320%2C350%2C370%2C380%2C401%2C402%2C411%2C412%2C413&show_ign=1&show_tmpign=1)** &mdash; Tool for detecting errors in OSM data.

**[mapmote](https://github.com/tmcw/mapmote)** &mdash; Slick tool for opening areas in OpenStreetMap in JOSM from browsing a web map. Powertool for power editors.

### Using the data

**[TileMill](http://mapbox.com/tilemill/)** &mdash; If you want to take the data and make your own maps, TileMill is a map design studio allowing you to create custom cartography.

**[Planet Data](http://planet.openstreetmap.org/)** &mdash; And if you want to be a real cowboy, you can download the entire planet of data; a **21 GB** gzipped file of raw open data. You're on your own here!
