## About OSM Tampa Bay

OSM Tampa Bay is a group that provides mappers, hobbyists, programmers, and outdoorsy types the chance to get together and build the best map of Tampa Bay.

### What is OpenStreetMap anyway?

[OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org) is an audacious project to build a free, open source map of the entire world, based completely on user contribution. It was founded in 2004 in the UK in response to the lack of open and available geospatial data. A group of map makers built a server system, grabbed their GPS units, and took to the streets to collect and consolidate all their data together to build a better map of London. “If I map my city, and you map your city, and we share our data… we both have a better map.”

### What does OSMTB do at [these things](http://meetup.com/osmtampabay)?

We’re dedicated to the original vision of OSM. By getting together and mapping our neighborhoods, we’ll all have a better map of our area. Anything and everything related to location, maps, and OSM is fair game for discussion at the OSMTB meetups.
