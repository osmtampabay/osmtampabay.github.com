# OSM Tampa Bay blog and website

This is the blog site for the [OSM Tampa Bay](http://meetup.com/osmtampabay) meetup group.

The blog is setup using [Jekyll]() so that all the content can be out in the open, and so outside contributors can write content on the site by sending pull requests through GitHub. Sorta experimental, but could be fun. The intent is to post content relevant to OSM, the Bay Area, or meetup activities like mapping parties or hacking days.

## Contributing

In the `_posts` directory, create a new post similar to the existing ones with a filename like `2012-03-31-post-name.md`. The content is then simply written in Markdown, saved, committed, and pushed back into master. The only other caveat is adding the YAML front-matter at the top of the `.md` file, containing the date, title, and author info.

Have at it!
